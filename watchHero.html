                              </div>
                         </div>

                         <h2>What is the experiment?</h2>
                         <p class="l-txt">It is a recreation of Apple's WatchOS hero section which rotates when the user scrolls down.</p><br>
                         
                         <h2>Challenge(s) I came across</h2>
                         <p class="l-txt">The first challenge was the circular orientation of the "watch faces", which I was able to resolve by finding a very clever piece of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/placing-items-circle/"  target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: lightseagreen;"><b>code</b></a>, courtesy of Ana Tudor.</p><br>
                         
                         <p class="l-txt">Secondly, positioning the circular div such that it is "fixed" and rotates till a certain scroll length, after which it scrolls up was tricky to figure out. In version one of this experiment, I solved this by keeping the position of the div fixed and after scrolling down that certain length the position became absolute. This was a very hacky and janky method especially since it required that I change the height of the wrapper div as well. Eventually this was resolved by using "position: sticky", which I previously did not have a good grasp and understanding of.</p><br>

                         <p class="l-txt">Lastly, the design of the watch faces. Although not a "challenge" per se, it was particularly time consuming.</p><br>
